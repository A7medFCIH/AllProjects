	- for more information about Game logic see attached PDF file

- I'm using Minimax Algorithm, with heuristic function XOR sum.

- Results, "winning" Just in your Dreams.


Beginner Training points:-
	- Add more heuristic functions.
	- There is a bug in algorithm minimax more than one step.
	- Convert Minimax to alpha, beta burning.
